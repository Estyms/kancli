# Kancli

This app is a fork of the [kancli demo](https://github.com/charmbracelet/kancli)
made on video by [Bashbunni](https://mastodon.technology/web/@bashbunni@mastodon.social).

In this fork I've fixed all the bugs I've found as well as implemented online save using charm.

## Usage

All the keybinds are shown below the kanban board, the major additions is the ability 
to delete a task by pressing ``d/backspace`` on a task

Your tasks are saved in charm when you enter the **Add Task** view and when you quit the app using ``q/esc``.

You can quit without saving by pressing ``ctrl+c``
